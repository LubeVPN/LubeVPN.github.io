<i class='fa fa-university'></i> **Cyamus Trading** ("**Cyamus**") is founded in 2019 by [Terry Li](https://bit.ly/terryli) (ex-VP of [796 Exchange](https://www.796.com), ex-CEO of [TDEx](https://www.tdex.com), and a license distributor of [Trading System Lab](https://www.tradingsystemlab.com) for the greater China region). Cyamus offers systematic trading and data analysis services to institutional clients who actively [seek asymmetric returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_payoff). In fact, we do not offer any trading system which **Annualized [Risk Return Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_return_ratio)** ([CAGR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) / [MDD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)) is lower than 6. We do not use the [two and twenty (or "2 and 20") fee arrangement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/two_and_twenty.asp). Ours is "0 and 30". Most of our investors prefer this fee structure, only paying if our trading system performs.

Our quantitative developers focus on researching and developing mid-frequency trading systems for the financial instruments that offer the highest [spread-to-pip potential](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/10/spread-pip-potential-pairs-day-trading.asp). We develop trading systems to trade the instruments that belong to these three categories: 1) **Japanese Yen Pairs**; 2) **Stock Index Pairs**; and 3) **Crypto Pairs**. The strategies that trade on the *Japanese Yen Pairs* and *Stock Index Pairs* have gone *LIVE* trading real money since February 2019; and the one that trade on the *Crypto Pairs* is still being tested in-house sooner become available for invited clients to trade *LIVE*:

<a href="/img_pr/Cyamus_Trading.pdf"><i class='fa fa-download'></i> Cyamus Clients' *LIVE* Trading Performance Reports & Testimonials in PDF</a>
{: .myDownloadButton}

We believe that spectacular *LIVE* trading results and satisfactory clients are only the electrifying parts our trading systems. You should also analyze our historical trading performance matrices in order to decide for yourselves if our trading system can compliment your existing investment style. In the following, we highlight some of the major performance measures:

- **[Maximum Drawdown (MDD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)** and **Annualized [Risk Return Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_return_ratio)** will help you work out your [risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp) allocation on a time horizon scale.
- **R-Expectancy** = Net Profit of All Trades ÷ Total Number of Trades ÷ Average Loss per Losing Trade = Average Profitability per Trade (APPT) ÷ Average Loss per Losing Trade (R). It will help you evaluate reward-to-risk ratio on a per trade level. In other words, it gives you an idea of the return that you can expect from our trading systems on the average per dollar risked.

### <i class='fa fa-bar-chart'></i> Performance Measures

The earliest trading system that we developed is on *Japanese Yen Pairs* (<b>USDJPY</b>, <b>EURJPY</b> and <b>GBPJPY</b>) are <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System**. The other trading system that Cyamus developed is on two (2) stock index pairs: <b>USA30.IDX/USD</b> and <b>DEU.IDX/EUR</b>. They have been traded *LIVE* since Feb 2019 on [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank).

Historical backtesting reports of the two trading systems are presented below. They share the same position entry setup and exit. They are simply constructed based on different position sizing techniques so that you can have a clearer picture of how the trading systems perform.

#### <i class='fa fa-cogs'></i> Dynamic Lot

Dynamic Lot as position sizing technique helps you understand how your investment may grow in time in percentage terms, effectively eliminating the factor of risk capital allocation. That is, no matter how much money you allocate to trade the systems initially, the performance measures can still be applicable because all new positions are dynamically sized based on **current account balance** (**CAB**) at time of opening a new position and **[maximum drawdown](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maximum-drawdown-mdd.asp)** (**MDD**).

- <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System**
  - Newly established position size equals to **0.01 x 10% x CAB/MDD**, where the 0.01 is the minimum transaction size on forex currency pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank), the 10% is the controlling factor for **[risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp)**, and the **MDD** is **-7.36%** based on 2004 to July 2020 historical performance data.
- <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System**:
  - Newly established position size equal to **0.1 x 10% x CAB/MDD**, where the 0.1 is the minimum transaction size on stock index pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank), the 10% is the controlling factor for **[risk capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riskcapital.asp)**, and the **MDD** is **-10.30%** based on 2014 to July 2020 historical performance data.

#### <i class='fa fa-cog'></i> Fixed Lot

Fixed Lot as position sizing technique allows us give you a fair and reasonable presentation of the **R-Expectancy**. It will help you evaluate reward-to-risk ratio on a per trade level. In other words, it gives you an idea of what to expect from our trading systems on the average (i.e. per dollar risked).

- All new position sizes are the same.
- <i class='fa fa-yen'></i> **Cyamus Yen Trading System**
  - All positions are opened with **0.01** [standard lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-lot.asp), which is the minimum transaction size on forex currency pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank) on forex currency pairs.
- <i class='fa fa-pie-chart'></i> **Cyamus Index Trading System**
  - All positions are opened with **0.1** [standard lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standard-lot.asp), which is the minimum transaction size on forex currency pairs permissible by [Dukascopy Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukascopy_Bank) on stock index [CFD](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/09/trade-a-cfd.asp)s.
